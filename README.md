# "Create a timer that can be started and stopped" for the "React Practice Calendar" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Eleventh and twelfth days of the calendar, now creating a simple timer!
- Easiest challenge by far, especially because I had a technical interview a couple days ago that asked something similar, albeit with an infinite image carousel
- Not much to say: set up the project in [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/?ref=reactpractice.dev#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) as suggested in the challenge, then modified the default styles to my liking
- Timer is very simple, using all items required in the challenge plus a couple extras that help the timer work better (for example, not allowing to click the **START** button repeatedly, and so)
- Took just a couple hours, but I'll use the rest time in order to take a break... Although I might be curious about what's next!

**NOTE:** nothing interesting to add, as it was quite simple (although a good showcase of how to use ```setInterval```, ```clearInterval``` and ```useRef```; those get asked about **A LOT** at interviews, so it is always a good practice!
